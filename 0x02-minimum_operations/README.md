# Minimum Operations Coding Challenge

This Python script `min_operations.py` is designed to solve the minimum operations coding challenge. Given an integer `n`, it computes the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` 'H' characters.

## Usage

To use this script, simply call the `minOperations` function in `min_operations.py` with an integer `n` as its argument. The function returns the minimum number of operations required.

```python
from min_operations import minOperations

n = 10
operations = minOperations(n)
print(f"The minimum number of operations to generate {n} 'H' characters is {operations}.")
